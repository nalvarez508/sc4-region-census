# sc4-region-census

Recompiled version of [Sawtooth's Region Census V0.8](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/17-sawtooths-region-census).

With extremely large regions, the original version would fail to produce an image. I decompiled the existing application, made it compatible with Python 2.7, and verified functionality.
